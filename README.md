# lighthouse-promises

- a promise can also reject your request

- you gotta be able to handle rejection!

- `catch` lets us do that

- `finally` fires always, regardless, useful for cleanup

- `finally` does not really mean "final".  it means "do this regardless"

- a return from a `catch` works the same as for a `then`
